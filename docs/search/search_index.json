RCT is for designers and manufacturers of RV-C components to ensure that their products are compatible with other RV-C components. The Importance of Compatibility Testing RV-C is a complex protocols and implementing it successfully requires both perfect understanding of the protocol intent and perfect accuracy in your code. Mistakes can do more than impair your own product - they can take down the entire network. Your product can work 100% reliably in your lab - but that doesn't guarantee anything about how it works in a real RV. Proper testing requires using reference devices built on an independent platform - not your own. And tests should have three key properties. Tests should be designed with a \"hacker's mentality\", attacking potential weaknesses rather than demonstrating strengths. The collection of tests should cover all possible incompatibilities. The tests should be repeatable, tester-independent, and produce a readable report. Just putting the product in an RV and running it for a while isn't enough. If in the course of your testing your engineers are praying that it works - that isn't really testing. In a real test, your test engineer should be aiming to make it fail and be just a little bit peeved when he doesn't break it. Why Use an Automated Tool Let's see how RCT lines up with the requirements of a proper testing regimen. Hacker's Mentality - RCT is written to be an attack dog. Complete Coverage - RCT covers 100% if the operations and failure modes listed in the official RVIA procedures. Repeatable - RCT tests can be repeated reliably and with precision timing. Tester-Independent - RCT doesn't rely on the test engineer to do anything but follow simple instructions. Readable Reports - At the end of the process, RCT provides full reports - including not just the pass/fail results but detailed data logs. RCT even provides a summary report that consolidates all the results for a device in a single document. But RCT's biggest benefit - it's fast . Most tests take just seconds and are so simple to execute, anyone can run them. The RVIA Tests RCT is based on the official RV-C Test Procedures, published by the RVIA ( https://www.rvia.org/rv-c/rv-c-testing-procedure-document ) How the RVIA Writes Tests The tests are written by a special subcommittee of the RV-C Technical Committee. This committee consists of vendors and OEMS with an interest in the reliability of RV-C networks. If you wish to join this important committee, contact the RVIA. The document is updated regularly, and updates can be tracked at https://www.rvia.org/rv-c . You do not have to be a member of the committee to propose additions or amendments. More information on the process is here https://www.rvia.org/rv-c/guide-rv-c-amendment-process . RCT and the RVIA Forms Here is a section from the Testing Procedures document.

We expect that most customers will be satisfied to see this report, but if not, the text can be cut-and-pasted into the RVIA's PDF file. How to Perform a test It couldn't be much easier. The first step is to create a profile to describe the product - its name and version, the company and tester. Then, for any particular test there may be details that need to be defined. For example, some address-claiming tests must know the product's Manufacturer ID to verify the ADDRESS_CLAIMED data is correct. Then running a test is (usually) just a matter of having Omniscope and the DUT ( Device Under Test ) connected on a network and selecting the test from the menu. RCT provides instructions as the test proceeds. The first section in the test log shows the process step-by-step. ================================================================================ Starting Test : A40 10-2025 Dynamic Addressing Bootup Setting Omniscope to Tools Start with an empty network, DUT powered off or disconnected. Power Up DUT Test A40 complete. ================================================================================ In this example, the tester selected Test - A-Addressing - A40: Dynamic Addressing Bootup . RCT responded by clearing the logging area and typing: ================================================================================ Starting Test : A40 10-2025 Dynamic Addressing Bootup Setting Omniscope to Tools Start with an empty network, DUT powered off or disconnected. At this point, RCT waits until is sees that the network is completely empty. Once the network is clear, it continues, typing: Power Up DUT At this point, RCT waits until you connect the device or power it up. In this particular test, it will process for a few seconds and then report: Test A40 complete. ================================================================================ It then generates the rest of the report. The report includes The interactive log created during the test. An important reminder that no test can root out every possible failure. All the profile data used in the test, plus a spot to add your own notes. The list of failure modes. For each mode, one of three results are possible. In most cases a reference to the data log is provided. DNP - Do Not Pass. RCT has detected a failure. PASS - Pass. RCT has determined that the product has avoided that failure. ___ - Contingent on User Inspection. Some failures cannot be fully evaluated automatically. The tester is required to analyze the log to evaluate success. The data log(s). This may show all the activity on the network, or may be filtered to specific devices or DGNs. Each message is timestamped and important messages are parsed for easy interpretation. The final step is to edit the log, replacing the ____ values with appropriate codes and entering any desired notes. Most tests take just a few seconds to perform and a little longer to evaluate. Your Responsibilities No test regimen is perfect, but with your help we can continuously improve the RV-C specification and the RCT program. Keep Your Eyes Open RCT has one significant problem - it's too fast and easy! It is so fast, it's easy to get complacent and miss seeing the occasional quirk or detail. Sometimes your product will pass a test just because it was lucky - this is especially true with any tests involving timing. We recommend running every test at least a couple times and to not consider a test passed unless all failures you detected along the way have been explained. Help Perfect the Specification It may be the case that your product passes every test in RCT and still fails in the field. The RVIA tests are written by humans whose imaginations are not infinite - you can't expect them to think of every possible failure mode or problematic interaction between products. When you discover such a failure, do yourself and the industry a favor and let us know. If you can describe the failure, and ideally, how to make that failure appear reliably - together we can devise a test to eliminate it. Help Perfect the Tool RCT was also written by humans and it may have bugs in it as well. Please report even the most trivial bugs - behind what seems a minor glitch might be a fatal error. Who to Contact To report issues with the RCT package, e-mail tech@trilliumelectronics.com. If the problem is with a specific test, run the test in Verbose mode and include the log with your e-mail.

If you want to install it elsewhere, the easiest way is to simply move or rename the Omniscope folder after installation. Managing Keys You may install and run Omniscope on as many computers as you wish, but each computer requires a key to connect to any specific RV-C adapter. Some Omniscope tools, such as RCT, have their own keys as well. To run such a tool your computer must contain valid keys for both Omniscope and the tool. A key is simply a piece of text, and keys are stored in one or more text files in the Omniscope folder or its subfolders. Omniscope scans every text file with a name starting in \"key\" and collects the keys they contain. It ignores duplicates and expired keys. If you are sharing adapters and tools across multiple computers, you can collect the keys in one or more key files and either copy them to each computer, or if the computers are networked, you can put the key files on a shared drive. In Omniscope, on each computer select Options-Change Key Folder and select the network folder. As old keys expire or you add more tools, you will need to add new keys. You may do this in one of three ways. Directly in Omniscope by selecting Options-Add New Key, and typing or cut-and-pasting the key text. This adds the key to the \"key.txt\" file. Adding a new key file to the folder. The filename must start with \"key\" and use the \".txt\" extension. Adding the key text to an existing key file. The text must not have any leading or trailing spaces or tabs. All keys are tied to a specific RV-C adapter ID. The ID should be printed on the adapter, or you can read it through Omniscope by selecting Option-Add New Key. The ID is an eight-character string. In the above example, the ID is \"FT5TM5WX\". Configuring Omniscope Most applications do not require any special configuration. In some cases you may need to access the following settings contained in the Options menu. Connection Options Connect on Startup. USB Adapter Type. The FT and OB series refers to the first two letters of the adapter ID. Data Rate. RV-C runs at 250 kbps. You can use Omniscope to log data from J1939 and other protocols, some of which run at 500 kbps. Advanced Options Scan Network. Change Module Base Folder. This setting allows the tools and support files to be placed in a separate drive or folder than the main program. This may be useful for networked computers. Reset Folders to Defaults. This resets the several folder settings. Change QuickScript file. Mute Mode. The RCT Tool will often disable Omniscope's ability to transmit messages. The tool should restore the setting at the end of the test, but if it fails you may need to manually restore this setting to \"Transmit NormallY\" Echo Tool Transmissions to Modules. The RCT Tool may also change this setting according to the requirements of a specific test. Most tools don't care, but if you want tool activity to show up in data logs, make sure this is enabled. Support Legacy DM1s. Show Phantom Devices. This can be necessary when trying to monitor products that are not fully RV-C compliant. If Omniscope crashes on startup, hold down the Alt key while starting up the program. This usually happens because the program can't find the adapter. You may wish to turn off the Connect on Startup setting. Running Omniscope Understanding the Main Window There are three windows within the main screen. At the left is the Device List. It displays every RV-C device found on the network and its diagnostic status. Note that a product may implement more than one \"device\" - an inverter/charger , for example, will show up as both an inverter and a charger . At the upper right is a window showing more details on whatever device is selected in the Device List. At lower right is the Module List, a list of tool modules that might be relevant to that device. You can also right-click on a device in the Device List and get a shorter list of the primary tool modules for that device. Running a Tool To run a tool module, first select the device that the tool is targeted to. If you select Service Tool , which is always at address 249, the tool module will target the entire network. Once a device is selected, you may either: Double-click on the Device. This will bring up the default tool module for that device, if one is defined. Right-click on the Device and select a tool module from the menu that appears. Double-click on a tool module in the Module List. Click on \"Run Module Not Listed Here\" and directly select the executable file. Select Modules-Run Unlisted Module or Modules-Run Selected Module. If you try to run a tool module directly through Windows, it generally will either not start or will start and do nothing useful, as it will lack the information from Omniscope necessary to run. Network Monitor Selecting Modules-Network Monitor brings up the Network Monitor box. This is an excellent tool for monitoring the overall status of the network. The grid indicates the 256 different source addresses available, and the colored boxes each indicate the node that is using that address. At the right are indicators of the overall network traffic and the traffic being generated by the selected node. At the bottom of the screen are more details about the selected node and a graphic representation of the message traffic. Each vertical bar in the traffic graphic represents a message transmitted by a specific node - the color of the bar matches the color in the grid. The bars for the selected node are taller than rest of the bars. The absolute maximum amount of traffic that an RV-C network can support is a little over 1200 messages per second. In practice, 700 messages per second is a more realistic boundary - some headroom is necessary to ensure that nodes can transmit messages reliably and process incoming messages without overflowing their queues. Useful Tools Universal Diagnostic Reader This is a general-purpose DM_RV reader, comparable to an auto technicians \"scanner\". Data Logger This data logging tool can be set to log data from specific addresses and/or specific DGNs, highlight certain addresses and/or DGNs, and it allows individual messages to be inspected. Logs can be saved to a file and played back with the Log Player. Log Playback The playback tool works with the files created by the data logger. You can click on a single message to play back that specific message, or if Run is selected, it shall begin playing back the log in sequence. The various settings have the following functions: Transmit. If checked, the messages are transmitted by the tool onto the RV-C network. The messages will be transmitted with the original source addresses, not Omniscope's. Sim Receive. If checked, the messages will be routed to any Omniscope tool modules currently running. Note that both of these can be checked. Run. If checked, the logged messages will be transmitted sequentially. If not, only the message clicked will be transmitted. Fast. If checked, the tool will attempt to play back the log at the speed it was taken. The playback timing is only approximate. If not checked, the playback will be approximately 10 messages per second. Loop. If checked, the log will be played back in a continuous loop. RV-C Sniffer This tool module parses incoming RV-C messages. Every message from the targeted node is immediately parsed and displayed, allowing troubleshooting in real time. The sniffer is also useful when analyzing logged data.

Some Omniscope tools, such as RCT, have their own keys as well. To run such a tool your computer must contain valid keys for both Omniscope and the tool. A key is simply a piece of text, and keys are stored in one or more text files in the Omniscope folder or its subfolders. Omniscope scans every text file with a name starting in \"key\" and collects the keys they contain. It ignores duplicates and expired keys. If you are sharing adapters and tools across multiple computers, you can collect the keys in one or more key files and either copy them to each computer, or if the computers are networked, you can put the key files on a shared drive. In Omniscope, on each computer select Options-Change Key Folder and select the network folder. As old keys expire or you add more tools, you will need to add new keys. You may do this in one of three ways. Directly in Omniscope by selecting Options-Add New Key, and typing or cut-and-pasting the key text. This adds the key to the \"key.txt\" file. Adding a new key file to the folder. The filename must start with \"key\" and use the \".txt\" extension. Adding the key text to an existing key file. The text must not have any leading or trailing spaces or tabs. All keys are tied to a specific RV-C adapter ID. The ID should be printed on the adapter, or you can read it through Omniscope by selecting Option-Add New Key. The ID is an eight-character string. In the above example, the ID is \"FT5TM5WX\".","title":"Managing Keys"},{"location":"omniscope/#configuring-omniscope","text":"Most applications do not require any special configuration.

The instructions here assume that Omniscope has been installed and the adapter is plugged into the PC USB port. All files are available for direct download at https://github.com/TrilliumElectronics/RCT_Public . You only need to download files with the .exe and .rvc extensions. Omniscope HP Some RCT tests require more precise timing than the standard Omniscope program allows. Therefore we created a slightly supercharged version, OmniscopeHP, just for RCT. You can run RCT on standard Omniscope but some tests won't give valid results, and you can run standard Omniscope tools on OmniscopeHP but there may be stability issues. To install OmniscopeHP, just copy OmniscopeHP.exe into your Omniscope folder. You may wish to drag it to the taskbar to \"pin\" the program there, and/or hold down the Alt key and drag it to the Desktop to creat a shortcut. OmniscopeHP will inherit all the settings and keys used by Omniscope, and you can go back-and-forth between using OmniscopeHP and Omniscope at will. Key Management To use RCT, you will need a key from Trillium Electronics. See the Omniscope page for instructions. Note that, like Omniscope, you can share RCT keys across computers. Running RCT In most cases, you will copy RVCCompTest.exe and RVCCompTest.rvc into your Omniscope folder. RCT does not need to be targeted towards a particular device in Omniscope. You may invoke RCT by any of the methods provided in the Omniscope program, or simply by running RVCCompTest.exe from Window Explorer or a command prompt after starting OmniscopeHP. Using Profiles A profile is a file containing the settings used during tests. It contains information on the product and company intended to help you track and organize your tests, as well as technical parameters uses in the tests. The data is stored in a text file with the .ocf extension. The File menu allows you to load and save the current profile, or reset the current profile to the default values. The Save option also allows you to create a new profile under a new name. The contents of the current profile are displayed in the box at the top of the screen. You may edit values by clicking on the left-down arrow at the right. Most technical parameters are group by the relevant tests - clicking the down arrow on the left will let you navigate to the test and the items used in that test. Note that the same setting may apply to multiple tests. Changing it for one test will change it for all. Note that some tests will modify data within the profile as you run them. The profile data is stored as plain text. You may take advantage of this to copy, search, or export the data. :Program COMPTEST :Version 1.0.0 :Created Friday, November 14, 2025 at 11:51:22 :SET Company=Rabblefish LLC :SET Product Name=RG150 :SET Product Version=1.03 :SET Tested By=Martin Perlot :SET Clear Text Log at Start=Yes :SET Restore Omniscope Mute/Echo Modes After Test=Yes :SET 250MS Timing Tolerance=10 ms :SET DSA For Address Claiming=253 We strongly recommend that all of the identification data - Company, Product Name/Version, and Test By - be completely and accurately entered in a consistent manner. The program will automatically add the date, time and the program version information to the record for each specific test run. Using Logs Most of the screen is dedicated to the test log. You can expand the box by dragging the lower-right corner of the program box with the mouse. When testing, the log box will display text as the test progresses. As the test runs, it will display the following types of messages: Progress messages, such as: Starting Test : A40 10-2025 Dynamic Addressing Bootup Setting Omniscope to Tools Test A40 complete. User Instructions, such as: Start with an empty network, DUT powered off or disconnected. Power Up DUT Follow the instructions. You don't usually have to hurry - the instructions will tell you if there is a time requirement. Error messasges, such as: DSA Category is not set. Aborting test. Unexpected ADDRESS_CLAIM received. Test is invalid. Aborting. Most errors will lead to the test being aborted. After the test is complete, the log box will display the following information: The test identifier - including the published month/year - and description. The date of the RCT code, for the individual test and the full RCT executable. The date and time of the test. The product and company information, from the profile.

By default RCT will name the file by the product name, test ID, and test date/time (e.g. RG150_A40_2512080846.txt ). You may edit this before saving. You may also copy the log to the clipboard. The test log may occasionally display messages outside the testing process. The OMNISCOPE may have crashed! message usually indicates that the Omniscope program has lost communications or otherwise stopped working. You may be able to revive Omniscope by selecting Reconnect from its menu. If not, usually you will need to close RCT and restart Omniscope and RCT again. If the problem persists, try to simplify your setup and run as few programs as possible. Windows is not a real-time operating system and OmniscopeHP needs as little latency as possible. Inspecting the Data In the results list, some failure modes will not have a PASS or DNP , but instead will have a blank line ( ____ ). These are items that require human inspection to confirm. The data logs should have all the relevant raw data. We recommend editing these fields after saving the log file to a file, using the inspectors initials to indicate a Pass. No automated test can catch every possible failure mode. Even for the simplest tests, it is essential that the tester inspect the data logs for discrepancies that the code didn't catch. Each data log may be filtered to make them easier to analyze. Typically they may be filtered to include only messages from specific addresses or specific DGNs. Consult the document for the specific test on this site. 1.096 18EE00D9 ADDRESS_CLAIMED 0EE00:D9 47 53 DF 0E 33 FF 00 80 ~~NAME=4753DF0E33FF0080 ~~ArbAddrCapable=1 ~~ManufacturerID=118 The first item in the log is the timestamp for the message. This is in seconds and milliseconds. Messages received are timed as they appear on the data bus. Unfortunately, messages sent by RCT through Omniscope are timed by when they are queued and thus can be off by several milliseconds. It is for this reason that most time-sensitive tests include a setting for the time error tolerance. The full entry is parsed as follows * Timestamp. 1.096 = 1.096 seconds since the start of the test. * Full CAN ID. 18EE00D9 = CAN Identifier * DGN Name. ADDRESS_CLAIMED * DGN. 0EE00 = DGN in hexadecimal. * Source Address D9 = Source Address in hexidecimal * Data. 47 53 DF 0E 33 FF 00 80 = Data packet, in hexidecimal. Following the message may be the literal parsing. The syntax follows the format used in the RV-C Sniffer. Editing the Test Log After the test is complete, the data log may be edited. This is a crucial step, allowing the addition of explanatory notes and the manual entry of test results. Some failure modes cannot be fully evaluated automatically and are indicated in the log with a \"____\" result. These blanks should be filled in manually. For clarity, the manual codes should be distinct from the automatic codes of DNP and PASS . For more information, click here . Aborting a Test If you need to terminate a test prematurely, select Test - Abort . You can select Test - Repeat Last Test to run the same test again. Saving the Results By selecting Log File - Save Log , you may save the log file to your drive. We highly recommend that you save the file with the name RCT automatically generates, and save all the test results for a particular product in the same folder. This will enable RCT to create an accurate and complete Summary Report. See Test File Management . Skipping a Test There are several reasons why you may wish to skip a test. The test may not apply to your specific product - e.g. the Static Addressing tests do not apply to Dynamically Addressed products. The test may not be required for the target application as defined by the OEM. Or your organization may have other reasons to delay testing. You can easily document the decision by selecting Test - Log a Skipped Test . You can select the test and the justification and RCT will generate a log file. You may edit the justification in the log file before saving the file to your drive. The test log will look something like this: ================================================================================ ================================================================================ ================================================================================ Test : A10 [10-2025] Static Addressing Bootup SKIPPED!!!

You may edit the Reason Skipped , which will appear in the Summary Report. Remember to save the log file. Troubleshooting Tests Tests - especially those involving timing of indeterminant events - don't always fit easily into a simple flowchart. If a test does not seem to advance as you expect, usually it is because your device is not responding as expected. In which case, congratulations! You have discovered a new failure mode. Contact Trillium Electronics and we'll update RCT to incorporate your discovery. However, it is possible that the fault lies in RCT, and our failure to fully capture the complexity of the interactions. If so, contact Trillium Electronics. Before you do, select Test - Verbose Mode and run the test again. Verbose Mode adds additional information to the test log specifically to facilite debugging. If the test \"hangs\", click the Dump Status button before aborting the test. Send that log, along with a description of your test setup and the problem you are encountering. Verbose Mode does not impact the validity of the test procedure itself. Staying Up-to-Date RCT is completely self-contained. The only file you need to update regularly is the executable itself. Version Checking By selecting About-Get Version Report , you can get a report in the log box describing the current version levels.

The program compilation date is relevant only if a significant bug is discovered in RCT itself. More important are the two dates given for each test. The first date (e.g. 10-1025 ) is the revision date of the test as it appears in the RV-C Test Procedures document. ( https://www.rvia.org/rv-c/rv-c-testing-procedure-document ) The second is the revision date of the code in RCT itself. The RCT code may change either due to a change in the published test or the discovery of a bug in the code. A change in either of these values suggests that a retest may be in order.

RCT is designed to make it easy to manage your results. The built-in Summary Report is likely the only tool you'll need to track your results. Basic Principles By default, when you save a log file after a test, RCT provides a default name that is specifically constructed to make the files easy to manage. The file name contains the product name (from the profile), the test ID, and a date/time code. The date/time is independent of the actual file date/time, thus allowing you to edit the results file without impacting the Summary Report. The Summary Report reads all the results files in a folder. Therefore we recommend that all log files for a particular product be kept in a single folder. It is not necessary to create folders for each product or product version. After running a test, you are expected to edit the file to add the results of your own inspection of the logs. This can be done directly after running the test. After the fact, you can reload a log file and edit it in RCT (use Log File - Read Log File ). You can also use almost any code editor or plain text editor. You are free to add notes to the file almost anywhere, as long as The existing lines are not disturbed. Your new lines do not start with '-' or '=', which are used to delimit the sections of the report. In general, you should not change any of the values in the first two sections of the file, and be careful in editing the third section (e.g. Test Profile, Product Version ). Testing Notes Within the third section is one special item - Testing Notes - which is intended to allow the tester to add explanatory information which will appear in the Summary Report. You can leave the field blank or delete it if you don't want any extra text added to the report. You can create multiple lines of notes by duplicating the Testing Notes : tag. ================================================================================ Test : A40 [10-2025] Dynamic Addressing Bootup Code Version : Revised 11-04-2025 Compiled Dec 15 2025 Test Date/Time : Monday, December 15, 2025 11:25:03 Test Profile : C:\\Temp\\TestProfile_3.ocf Company : Rabblefish LLC Product Name : RG150 Product Version : 1.03 Tested By : Martin Perlot Testing Notes : Tested on prototype hardware. Testing Notes : Test again when the new hardware arrives. DSA Category = Appliances and Bridges This text will not show up in the Summary Report. You can use notes like this almost anywhere in the log. You may wish to add notes like these to the Data Log section, marking important messages. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Editing the Test Results The fourth section, in which the test results are reported, you are expected to update the results in accordance with the results of the final human inspection of the logs. In the following example, two such edits were made: -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- PASS : Request does not use SA FEh PASS : Request target is outside the device's dynamic range. PASS : Another message precedes the request. PASS : The request payload is not 8 bytes. PASS : The requested DGN is not EE00h. PASS : A global request for ADDRESS_CLAIM is transmitted. PASS : The device attempts to claim multiple addresses. DNP : ADDRESS_CLAIM does not match previous claims. Expected = 47 53 FF 0D 33 FF 00 80 , Actual = 47 53 DF 0E 33 FF 00 80 1.096 18EE00D9 ADDRESS_CLAIMED 0EE00:D9 47 53 DF 0E 33 FF 00 80 PASS : DUT does not change address. Address changed. Initial=218 Final=217 PASS : Other message broadcast before Requesting new ADDRESS_CLAIM. DNP : Less than 250ms elapsed between Requesting ADDRESS_CLAIM and transmitting ADDRESS_CLAIM. Delay = 224 ms 1.096 18EE00D9 ADDRESS_CLAIMED 0EE00:D9 47 53 DF 0E 33 FF 00 80 IGNORE : Less than 250ms elapsed between transmitting ADDRESS_CLAIM and operational DGNs. PASS : ADDRESS_CLAIM does not match address requested. PASS : ADDRESS_CLAIM does not match address used in operation. PASS : DUT claims multiple addresses. OK : Logs have been examined for other possible failure modes. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- In this example, a DNP was replaced by IGNORE , and the blank result for the final test was replaced by OK . You are free to make up your own codes of up to six letters, and we strongly recommend that you be consistent with them. To distinguish human judgment from the cold-hearted machine results, the results of a human inspection should not be DNP or PASS . The code must be entered at the start of the line and followed immediately by a colon. The Summary Report To obtain a Summary Report, load the profile for the desired product, select Log File - Build Summary Report , and select the folder containing the test results. RCT will scan the folder, examining every .txt file. If the Product Name and Product Version in the file matches (and the file is a valid results file), RCT will process the file. Once all the files are read, RCT will output the results for each different test, always chosing the most recent file of that particular test. Note that the file date to determine which test is most recent is determined by the date encoded in file name. The date/time reported is determined by the contents of the file. If you wish to \"promote\" a particular log file to the top, edit the file name, changing the time code (e.g. 2604011200 ) to today's date. The results are displayed in the log and may be saved be selecting Log File - Save Log , or copied to the clipboard.
