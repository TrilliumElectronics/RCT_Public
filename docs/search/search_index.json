If you want to install it elsewhere, the easiest way is to simply move or rename the Omniscope folder after installation. Managing Keys You may install and run Omniscope on as many computers as you wish, but each computer requires a key to connect to any specific RV-C adapter. Some Omniscope tools, such as RCT, have their own keys as well. To run such a tool your computer must contain valid keys for both Omniscope and the tool. A key is simply a piece of text, and keys are stored in one or more text files in the Omniscope folder or its subfolders. Omniscope scans every text file with a name starting in \"key\" and collects the keys they contain. It ignores duplicates and expired keys. If you are sharing adapters and tools across multiple computers, you can collect the keys in one or more key files and either copy them to each computer, or if the computers are networked, you can put the key files on a shared drive. In Omniscope, on each computer select Options-Change Key Folder and select the network folder. As old keys expire or you add more tools, you will need to add new keys. You may do this in one of three ways. Directly in Omniscope by selecting Options-Add New Key, and typing or cut-and-pasting the key text. This adds the key to the \"key.txt\" file. Adding a new key file to the folder. The filename must start with \"key\" and use the \".txt\" extension. Adding the key text to an existing key file. The text must not have any leading or trailing spaces or tabs. All keys are tied to a specific RV-C adapter ID. The ID should be printed on the adapter, or you can read it through Omniscope by selecting Option-Add New Key. The ID is an eight-character string. In the above example, the ID is \"FT5TM5WX\". Configuring Omniscope Most applications do not require any special configuration. In some cases you may need to access the following settings contained in the Options menu. Connection Options Connect on Startup. USB Adapter Type. The FT and OB series refers to the first two letters of the adapter ID. Data Rate. RV-C runs at 250 kbps. You can use Omniscope to log data from J1939 and other protocols, some of which run at 500 kbps. Advanced Options Scan Network. Change Module Base Folder. This setting allows the tools and support files to be placed in a separate drive or folder than the main program. This may be useful for networked computers. Reset Folders to Defaults. This resets the several folder settings. Change QuickScript file. Mute Mode. The RCT Tool will often disable Omniscope's ability to transmit messages. The tool should restore the setting at the end of the test, but if it fails you may need to manually restore this setting to \"Transmit NormallY\" Echo Tool Transmissions to Modules. The RCT Tool may also change this setting according to the requirements of a specific test. Most tools don't care, but if you want tool activity to show up in data logs, make sure this is enabled. Support Legacy DM1s. Show Phantom Devices. This can be necessary when trying to monitor products that are not fully RV-C compliant. If Omniscope crashes on startup, hold down the Alt key while starting up the program. This usually happens because the program can't find the adapter. You may wish to turn off the Connect on Startup setting. Running Omniscope Understanding the Main Window There are three windows within the main screen. At the left is the Device List. It displays every RV-C device found on the network and its diagnostic status. Note that a product may implement more than one \"device\" - an inverter/charger , for example, will show up as both an inverter and a charger . At the upper right is a window showing more details on whatever device is selected in the Device List. At lower right is the Module List, a list of tool modules that might be relevant to that device. You can also right-click on a device in the Device List and get a shorter list of the primary tool modules for that device. Running a Tool To run a tool module, first select the device that the tool is targeted to. If you select Service Tool , which is always at address 249, the tool module will target the entire network. Once a device is selected, you may either: Double-click on the Device. This will bring up the default tool module for that device, if one is defined. Right-click on the Device and select a tool module from the menu that appears. Double-click on a tool module in the Module List. Click on \"Run Module Not Listed Here\" and directly select the executable file. Select Modules-Run Unlisted Module or Modules-Run Selected Module. If you try to run a tool module directly through Windows, it generally will either not start or will start and do nothing useful, as it will lack the information from Omniscope necessary to run. Network Monitor Selecting Modules-Network Monitor brings up the Network Monitor box. This is an excellent tool for monitoring the overall status of the network. The grid indicates the 256 different source addresses available, and the colored boxes each indicate the node that is using that address. At the right are indicators of the overall network traffic and the traffic being generated by the selected node. At the bottom of the screen are more details about the selected node and a graphic representation of the message traffic. Each vertical bar in the traffic graphic represents a message transmitted by a specific node - the color of the bar matches the color in the grid. The bars for the selected node are taller than rest of the bars. The absolute maximum amount of traffic that an RV-C network can support is a little over 1200 messages per second. In practice, 700 messages per second is a more realistic boundary - some headroom is necessary to ensure that nodes can transmit messages reliably and process incoming messages without overflowing their queues. Useful Tools Universal Diagnostic Reader This is a general-purpose DM_RV reader, comparable to an auto technicians \"scanner\". Data Logger This data logging tool can be set to log data from specific addresses and/or specific DGNs, highlight certain addresses and/or DGNs, and it allows individual messages to be inspected. Logs can be saved to a file and played back with the Log Player. Log Playback The playback tool works with the files created by the data logger. You can click on a single message to play back that specific message, or if Run is selected, it shall begin playing back the log in sequence. The various settings have the following functions: Transmit. If checked, the messages are transmitted by the tool onto the RV-C network. The messages will be transmitted with the original source addresses, not Omniscope's. Sim Receive. If checked, the messages will be routed to any Omniscope tool modules currently running. Note that both of these can be checked. Run. If checked, the logged messages will be transmitted sequentially. If not, only the message clicked will be transmitted. Fast. If checked, the tool will attempt to play back the log at the speed it was taken. The playback timing is only approximate. If not checked, the playback will be approximately 10 messages per second. Loop. If checked, the log will be played back in a continuous loop. RV-C Sniffer This tool module parses incoming RV-C messages. Every message from the targeted node is immediately parsed and displayed, allowing troubleshooting in real time. The sniffer is also useful when analyzing logged data. Use the playback tool with the Sim Receive box checked, and run the sniffer alongside it. If you have trouble targeting the specific address that you want to sniff, use the Network Monitor, click the grid at the desired address, and click the 'Run Module' button.","title":"Omniscope"},{"location":"omniscope/#introduction-to-omniscope","text":"","title":"Introduction to Omniscope"},{"location":"omniscope/#installation","text":"","title":"Installation"},{"location":"omniscope/#installing-the-files","text":"By default, the installation program installs Omniscope.exe and the supporting files and tools at C:\\Omniscope.

The instructions here assume that Omniscope has been installed and the adapter is plugged into the PC USB port. Omniscope HP Some RCT tests require more precise timing than the standard Omniscope program allows. Therefore we created a slightly supercharged version, OmniscopeHP, just for RCT. You can run RCT on standard Omniscope but some tests won't give valid results, and you can run standard Omniscope tools on OmniscopeHP but there may be stability issues. To install OmniscopeHP, just copy OmniscopeHP.exe into your Omniscope folder. You may wish to drag it to the taskbar to \"pin\" the program there, and/or hold down the Alt key and drag it to the Desktop to creat a shortcut. OmniscopeHP will inherit all the settings and keys used by Omniscope, and you can go back-and-forth between using OmniscopeHP and Omniscope at will. Key Management To use RCT, you will need a key from Trillium Electronics. See the Omniscope page for instructions. Note that, like Omniscope, you can share RCT keys across computers. Running RCT RCT does not need to be targeted towards a particular device in Omniscope. You may invoke RCT by any of the methods provided in the Omniscope program, or simply by running RVCCompTest.exe from Window Explorer or a command prompt after starting OmniscopeHP. Using Profiles A profile is a file containing the settings used during tests. It contains information on the product and company intended to help you track and organize your tests, as well as technical parameters uses in the tests. The data is stored in a text file with the .ocf extension. The File menu allows you to load and save the current profile, or reset the current profile to the default values. The Save option also allows you to create a new profile under a new name. The contents of the current profile are displayed in the box at the top of the screen. You may edit values by clicking on the left-down arrow at the right. Most technical parameters are group by the relevant tests - clicking the down arrow on the left will let you navigate to the test and the items used in that test. Note that the same setting may apply to multiple tests. Changing it for one test will change it for all. The program does not automatically save the profile information, and some tests will modify data within the profile. Note that the profile data is stored as plain text. You may take advantage of this to copy, search, or export the data. :Program COMPTEST :Version 1.0.0 :Created Friday, November 14, 2025 at 11:51:22 :SET Company=Rabblefish LLC :SET Product Name=RG150 :SET Product Version=1.03 :SET Tested By=Martin Perlot :SET Clear Text Log at Start=Yes :SET Restore Omniscope Mute/Echo Modes After Test=Yes :SET 250MS Timing Tolerance=10 ms :SET DSA For Address Claiming=253 We strongly recommend that all of the identification data - Company, Product Name/Version, and Test By - be completely and accurately entered in a consistent manner. The program will automatically add the date, time and the program version information to the record for each specific test run. Using Logs Most of the screen is dedicated to the test log. You can expand the box by dragging the lower-right corner of the program box with the mouse. When testing, the log box will display text as the test progresses. As the test runs, it will display the following types of messages: Progress messages, such as: Starting Test : A40 10-2025 Dynamic Addressing Bootup Setting Omniscope to Tools Test A40 complete. User Instructions, such as: Start with an empty network, DUT powered off or disconnected. Power Up DUT Follow the instructions. You don't usually have to hurry - the instructions will tell you if there is a time requirement. Error messasges, such as: DSA Category is not set. Aborting test. Unexpected ADDRESS_CLAIM received. Test is invalid. Aborting. Most errors will lead to the test being aborted. After the test is complete, the log box will display the following information: The test identifier - including the published month/year - and description. The date of the RCT code, for the individual test and the full RCT executable. The date and time of the test. The product and company information, from the profile. All settings from the profile used in the test. Test : A40 [10-2025] Dynamic Addressing Bootup Code Version : Revised 11-4-2025 Compiled Dec 8 2025 Test Date/Time : Monday, December 08, 2025 10:04:13 Test Profile : C:\\Temp\\TestProfile_3.ocf Company : Rabblefish LLC Product Name : RG150 Product Version : 1.03 Tested By : Martin Perlot DSA Category = Appliances and Bridges The list of potential failure modes, with the PASS/DNP result. If DNP, usually a description of the failure, plus the offending message is included. PASS : Request does not use SA FEh PASS : Request target is outside the device's dynamic range. PASS : Another message precedes the request. PASS : The request payload is not 8 bytes. PASS : The requested DGN is not EE00h. PASS : A global request for ADDRESS_CLAIM is transmitted. PASS : The device attempts to claim multiple addresses. ____ : Logs have been examined for other possible failure modes. (Usually) One or more data logs. Some messages in the log may be parsed.

By default RCT will name the file by the product name, test ID, and test date/time (e.g. RG150_A40_2512080846.txt ). You may edit this before saving. You may also copy the log to the clipboard. The test log may occasionally display messages outside the testing process. The OMNISCOPE may have crashed! message usually indicates that the Omniscope program has lost communications or otherwise stopped working. You may be able to revive Omniscope by selecting Reconnect from its menu. If not, usually you will need to close RCT and restart Omniscope and RCT again. If the problem persists, try to simplify your setup and run as few programs as possible. Windows is not a real-time operating system and OmniscopeHP needs as little latency as possible. Inspecting the Data In the results list, some failure modes will not have a PASS or DNP , but instead will have a blank line ( ____ ). These are items that require human inspection to confirm. The data logs should have all the relevant raw data. We recommend editing these fields after saving the log file to a file, using the inspectors initials to indicate a Pass. No automated test can catch every possible failure mode. Even for the simplest tests, it is essential that the tester inspect the data logs for discrepancies that the code didn't catch. Each data log may be filtered to make them easier to analyze. Typically they may be filtered to include only messages from specific addresses or specific DGNs. Consult the document for the specific test on this site. 1.096 18EE00D9 ADDRESS_CLAIMED 0EE00:D9 47 53 DF 0E 33 FF 00 80 ~~NAME=4753DF0E33FF0080 ~~ArbAddrCapable=1 ~~ManufacturerID=118 The first item in the log is the timestamp for the message. This is in seconds and milliseconds. Messages received are timed as they appear on the data bus. Unfortunately, messages sent by RCT through Omniscope are timed by when they are queued and thus can be off by several milliseconds. It is for this reason that most time-sensitive tests include a setting for the time error tolerance. The full entry is parsed as follows * Timestamp. 1.096 = 1.096 seconds since the start of the test. * Full CAN ID. 18EE00D9 = CAN Identifier * DGN Name. ADDRESS_CLAIMED * DGN. 0EE00 = DGN in hexadecimal. * Source Address D9 = Source Address in hexidecimal * Data. 47 53 DF 0E 33 FF 00 80 = Data packet, in hexidecimal. Following the message may be the literal parsing. The syntax follows the format used in the RV-C Sniffer. Aborting a Test If you need to terminate a test prematurely, select Test - Abort . You can select Test - Repeat Last Test to run the same test again. Troubleshooting Tests Tests - especially those involving timing of indeterminant events - don't always fit easily into a simple flowchart. If a test does not seem to advance as you expect, usually it is because your device is not responding as expected. In which case, congratulations! You have discovered a new failure mode. Contact Trillium Electronics and we'll update RCT to incorporate your discovery. However, it is possible that the fault lies in RCT, and our failure to fully capture the complexity of the interactions. If so, contact Trillium Electronics. Before you do, select Test - Verbose Mode and run the test again. Verbose Mode adds additional information to the test log specifically to facilite debugging. If the test \"hangs\", click the Dump Status button before aborting the test. Send that log, along with a description of your test setup and the problem you are encountering. Verbose Mode does not impact the validity of the test procedure itself. Staying Up-to-Date RCT is completely self-contained. The only file you need to update regularly is the executable itself. Version Checking By selecting About-Get Version Report , you can get a report in the log box describing the current version levels.

The program compilation date is relevant only if a significant bug is discovered in RCT itself. More important are the two dates given for each test. The first date (e.g. 10-1025 ) is the revision date of the test as it appears in the RV-C Test Procedures document. ( https://www.rvia.org/rv-c/rv-c-testing-procedure-document ) The second is the revision date of the code in RCT itself. The RCT code may change either due to a change in the published test or the discovery of a bug in the code. A change in either of these values suggests that a retest may be in order.

If DNP, usually a description of the failure, plus the offending message is included. PASS : Request does not use SA FEh PASS : Request target is outside the device's dynamic range. PASS : Another message precedes the request. PASS : The request payload is not 8 bytes. PASS : The requested DGN is not EE00h. PASS : A global request for ADDRESS_CLAIM is transmitted. PASS : The device attempts to claim multiple addresses. ____ : Logs have been examined for other possible failure modes. (Usually) One or more data logs. Some messages in the log may be parsed.

By default RCT will name the file by the product name, test ID, and test date/time (e.g. RG150_A40_2512080846.txt ). You may edit this before saving. You may also copy the log to the clipboard. The test log may occasionally display messages outside the testing process. The OMNISCOPE may have crashed! message usually indicates that the Omniscope program has lost communications or otherwise stopped working. You may be able to revive Omniscope by selecting Reconnect from its menu. If not, usually you will need to close RCT and restart Omniscope and RCT again. If the problem persists, try to simplify your setup and run as few programs as possible. Windows is not a real-time operating system and OmniscopeHP needs as little latency as possible.","title":"Using Logs"},{"location":"rct/#inspecting-the-data","text":"In the results list, some failure modes will not have a PASS or DNP , but instead will have a blank line ( ____ ). These are items that require human inspection to confirm. The data logs should have all the relevant raw data. We recommend editing these fields after saving the log file to a file, using the inspectors initials to indicate a Pass. No automated test can catch every possible failure mode. Even for the simplest tests, it is essential that the tester inspect the data logs for discrepancies that the code didn't catch. Each data log may be filtered to make them easier to analyze. Typically they may be filtered to include only messages from specific addresses or specific DGNs. Consult the document for the specific test on this site. 1.096 18EE00D9 ADDRESS_CLAIMED 0EE00:D9 47 53 DF 0E 33 FF 00 80 ~~NAME=4753DF0E33FF0080 ~~ArbAddrCapable=1 ~~ManufacturerID=118 The first item in the log is the timestamp for the message. This is in seconds and milliseconds. Messages received are timed as they appear on the data bus. Unfortunately, messages sent by RCT through Omniscope are timed by when they are queued and thus can be off by several milliseconds. It is for this reason that most time-sensitive tests include a setting for the time error tolerance. The full entry is parsed as follows * Timestamp. 1.096 = 1.096 seconds since the start of the test. * Full CAN ID. 18EE00D9 = CAN Identifier * DGN Name. ADDRESS_CLAIMED * DGN. 0EE00 = DGN in hexadecimal. * Source Address D9 = Source Address in hexidecimal * Data. 47 53 DF 0E 33 FF 00 80 = Data packet, in hexidecimal. Following the message may be the literal parsing. The syntax follows the format used in the RV-C Sniffer.","title":"Inspecting the Data"},{"location":"rct/#aborting-a-test","text":"If you need to terminate a test prematurely, select Test - Abort .

If a test does not seem to advance as you expect, usually it is because your device is not responding as expected. In which case, congratulations! You have discovered a new failure mode. Contact Trillium Electronics and we'll update RCT to incorporate your discovery. However, it is possible that the fault lies in RCT, and our failure to fully capture the complexity of the interactions. If so, contact Trillium Electronics. Before you do, select Test - Verbose Mode and run the test again. Verbose Mode adds additional information to the test log specifically to facilite debugging. If the test \"hangs\", click the Dump Status button before aborting the test. Send that log, along with a description of your test setup and the problem you are encountering.

The program compilation date is relevant only if a significant bug is discovered in RCT itself. More important are the two dates given for each test. The first date (e.g. 10-1025 ) is the revision date of the test as it appears in the RV-C Test Procedures document. ( https://www.rvia.org/rv-c/rv-c-testing-procedure-document ) The second is the revision date of the code in RCT itself.
